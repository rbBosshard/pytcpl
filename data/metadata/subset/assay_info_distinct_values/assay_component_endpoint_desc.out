Data from the assay component ATG_RORg_TRANS was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint. 

This assay endpoint, ATG_RORg_TRANS, was analyzed in the positive analysis fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. 

Using a type of inducible reporter, measures of mRNA for gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand the reporter gene at the transcription factor-level as they relate to the gene RORC. 

Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a reporter gene function. 

To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the nuclear receptor intended target family, where the subfamily is orphan.
