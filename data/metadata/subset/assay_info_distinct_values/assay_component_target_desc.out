Vein growth supports angiogenesis, which is critical for development, maturation, and reproductive function. Dysregulation of angiogenesis can lead to birth defects, macular degeneration, impaired wound healing, and tumor growth. This assay measures compound effects on vein formation in basal medium, which lacks growth factors that support blood vessel growth. Tube formation agonists will increase vessel growth in these conditions.

The iodide recycling enzyme, iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD), is one conserved putative molecular target that plays an essential role in maintaining adequate levels of free iodide in the thyroid gland for hormone synthesis.
The technology is based on the concept of Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer BRET. Target proteins fused to NanoLuc luciferase generate luminescence signal in the presence of furimazine substrate. BRET occurs when custom fluorescent tracers, bound to the target protein, resonate luminescent energy from the luciferase enzyme to the tracer molecule to yield a lower-energy fluorescent emission signal.
The ratio of acceptor signal fluorescence to donor signal luminescence yields a normalized quantitative value in milliBRET Units mBU that can be used to evaluate direct disruption of small molecule target protein interactions of 5 alpha reductase.
Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is one the major transport proteins responsible for binding to and transporting thyroid hormones to the necessary tissues.
Transthyretin (TTR) is one the major transport proteins responsible for binding to and transporting thyroid hormones to the necessary tissues.
Deiodinase enzymes play an essential role in converting thyroid hormones between active and inactive forms by deiodinating the pro-hormone thyroxine (T4) to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) and modifying T4 and T3 to inactive forms.  DIO3 inactivates both T4 and T3 by removing an inner ring iodine, producing reverse T3 (rT3) and diiodotyrosine (T2), respectively.
