The human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) regulates the expression of several drug metabolizing enzymes and induction of these proteins is a major mechanism for developing drug resistance in cancer. One such key enzyme catalyzing the drug metabolism is cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Changes in CYP3A4 expression affect drug metabolism, thereby reducing the therapeutic efficacy and altering toxicological response to a drug and which finally causes adverse drug interaction.

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor (TRHR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor which binds the tripeptide thyrotropin releasing hormone. TRHR is found in the brain and, when bound by TRH, acts (through phospholipase C) to increase intracellular inositol trisphosphate. It plays a crucial role in the anterior pituitary where it controls the synthesis and secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone and prolactin. Intracellular calcium is measured as an indicator of Gq-coupled human thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) activation using fluorescent detection in a TRHR-Hek293 cell-based assay. Activation of this GPCR is indicated by increased intracellular calcium as measured in this cell-based fluorescent reporter assay.

Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death and plays a central role in the development of multicellular organisms. It is a highly regulated process and induces cell death by activating caspases, which are the members of cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease (caspase) family. Caspases involved in apoptosis are classified by their mechanism of action as initiator caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9 and -10) and executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7). Inhibition of apoptosis results in number of cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and viral infection.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily consists of a large number of structurally related dimeric proteins that act as hormones or local mediators in regulating a wide range of biological functions. This superfamily includes TGF-betas themselves, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and the activins. These ligands induce oligomerization of serine/threonine receptor kinases and phosphorylate the cytoplasmic signaling molecules of Smad protein family.
