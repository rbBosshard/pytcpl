Changes to fluorescence intensity signals are indicative of inducible changes in transcription factor activity. This is quantified by the level of mRNA reporter sequence unique to the transfected trans-acting reporter gene and exogenous transcription factor GAL4-RORg, also known as human RAR-related orphan receptor C [GeneSymbol:RORC | GeneID:6097 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P51449].
