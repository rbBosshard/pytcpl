The migration distance of radial glia at 120 hr is assessed in Âµm from the edge of the sphere core  to the edge of the migration area based on fluorescent images of Hoechst-positive nuclei. With the identification of each nucleus position around the sphere core,  migration-related parameters can be calculated. First, a nuclei density distribution is calculated for which an algorithm determines relatively more and less dense nuclei areas. This calculation identifies the sphere core by the densest nuclei area in the image. The algorithm further assumes that nuclei density decreases from the sphere core to the periphery. When the nuclei density hits a pre-defined threshold, the outer boundaries of the migration area are determined and the sphere itself is mapped out in a polynomial bounding box. Derived from this box, the size of the migration area and the migration distance are calculated for each well.
